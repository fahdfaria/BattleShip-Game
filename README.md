# BattleShip-Game
This is my version of the Battleship game. Enjoy! :)

Instructions:

- There is 8 ships propagated randomly across the table.

- You have 18 chances to locate all 8 ships.

- Once you hit 18 chances, the app will display a stats message and to restart the Game

- CHEAT: Location of ships can be viewed in the console ;)


Code/Technical information :

- Usage of Javascript and Jquery

- HTML Table with ids on each td;

- ids = location of cells

- Array with cell string ex = 0A,0B etc..

- Function that pull 8 random cells from an array and pushes them in locations array

- Jquery onclick function to check if id of tag equals to string in location array
